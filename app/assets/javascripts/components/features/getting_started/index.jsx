      <p>You can follow people if you know their username and the domain they are on by entering an e-mail-esque address into the form in the bottom of the sidebar.</p>
      <p>If the target user is on the same domain as you, just the username will work. The same rule applies to mentioning people in statuses.</p>
      <p>The developer of this project can be followed as Gargron@mastodon.social</p>
